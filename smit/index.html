<p3>.My Future Career The future career that I choose is a Cyber security expert. The interest that I developed in this career was due to a lot of what I’ve saw in the news over the years and from what I’ve personally experienced over the years. A large majority of companies and government agencies hire these experts to help strengthen networks, safeguard information, or prevent cyber-attacks. That’s the part that really interested meer-attacks. With a large amount of hacker groups out there, there needs be just as many hackers that do good rather than bad. So this what I want to do. I want to be the person to help prevent these attacks, or even stop them. Cyber Security experts as basically people that watch data logs, set up security</p3>

<hr><h4><center>(Information Security)</center></h4>
<p4><i><font color ="grey">Today’s IT teams are facing a sophisticated generation of cybercriminals. Hackers are attacking more layers of the hardware-software stack, and with new connected devices being added to corporate networks, there are a growing number of potential entry points to target.
    One of the most important <font color="iceblue">information security and risk management</font> strategies is to emphasize protection at every point in the network. Intel IT has taken their information security (InfoSec) practices to a new level with a <font color="iceblue">Cyber Intelligence Platform (CIP)</font>. CIP ingests data from hundreds of sources and security tools. With access to real-time data, streams processing, machine-learning tools, consistent data models, and orchestration and automation capabilities, Intel IT can detect and respond to incidents within hours or minutes, instead of days or weeks. CIP infrastructure is based on Intel® Xeon® Platinum processors, Intel® 3D NAND solid state drives (SSDs), and Intel® Optane™ SSDs.
    It’s also important to employ both hardware- and software-based security technologies. For example, for business PCs, the <font color="iceblue">Intel vPro® platform</font> provides enhanced protections against attacks below the operating system (OS) and advanced threat detection capabilities with Intel® Hardware Shield.
