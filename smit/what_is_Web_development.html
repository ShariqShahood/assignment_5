        <p1><b>What is website development?</b></p1><hr><br><p2>Website development is the creation, build and maintenance of a website. This includes markup <b>(the language developers use to create websites)</b>, coding <i>(the programming language)</i>, network configuration and Content Management Systems <i><font color="#255ACD"><strong>(CMS)</strong></font></i>.<br>
            Many use "web development" to describe the actual construction of websites. It includes what you'll find <b>"under the hood,"</b> or on a website's backend, as well as any coding needed for the frontend (the visible interface of a website). Web development also consists of programming languages, frameworks, libraries and more. <br>
            In this vein, website development is mostly completed by developers who write the code—including HTML, <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>  <strong><font color="red">(CSS)</font></strong> and Javascript—that allows a website to function properly. They often collaborate with website designers, graphic designers, content managers, project managers, and software developers. Various day-to-day tasks include as translating wireframes into code, creating a website's structure and architecture, building out the functionality and features, launching a site, updating or renovating a website and, of course, troubleshooting, fixing bugs and glitches. Web developers strive to keep the end user's needs front and center.<br>
            <strong>How does web development differ from web design and cyber security?</strong> While web developers create, manage and maintain websites, web designers focus on the look and feel of a website, deciding on the colors, typography and user experience flow. Cybersecurity professionals, on the other hand, protect these websites from viruses, attackers and malicious code.
