<p>Everybody has an Ambition OR Aim  in life.No man can do anything in the world without aim.
So,all of us should be very determined about our aim in life.</br>An aimless person is like a ship 
that has lost its control over the sea.
 The Aim is defined as a strong will to achieve something. Every person must have a well-defined objective in life. 
 It helps a person to understand the direction of his/her career. </p>
