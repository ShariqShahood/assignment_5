        <p1>Mobile application development is the process of making software for smartphones, tablets and digital assistants, most commonly for the Android and iOS operating systems. The software can be preinstalled on the device, downloaded from a mobile app store or accessed through a mobile web browser. The programming and markup languages used for this kind of software development include <font color="red">Java, Swift, C# </font>and <font color="red">HTML5</font>.</p1>
        <br><br><p2>Mobile app development is rapidly growing. From retail, telecommunications and e-commerce to insurance, healthcare and government, organizations across industries must meet user expectations for real-time, convenient ways to conduct transactions and access information.

To stay relevant, responsive and successful, organizations need to develop the mobile applications that their customers, partners and employees demand.</p2>
